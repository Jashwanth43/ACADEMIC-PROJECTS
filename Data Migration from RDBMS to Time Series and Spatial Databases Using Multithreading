In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rise of sensor networks has become important in real-time data collection.
This paper addresses the challenges posed by traditional relational databases in handling extensive time-series and spatial
data generated by IoT sensors. Focusing on the migration from MySQL and live data to specialized databases like InfluxDB
and PostGIS, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework. By using multithreading, the migration process is optimized
for efficiency. Simulation of IoT data is done by generating the relevant data. Migration without multithreading and with
multithreading has been done and the time taken by these processes has been compared. The results show that the data
migration with multithreading is faster than the migration without multithreading. By seamlessly transitioning weather sensor-
generated time series and spatial data, this paper can be used as a blueprint for data migration of time series and spatial
data, addressing the demands of the IoT era. The study underscores the significance of efficient data migration in preserving
historical data while ensuring seamless migration with new databases. Data validation and analysis have also been done to
ensure data integrity and usage


                                                  INTRODUCTION
In this modern era of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor networks have been growing very rapidly, playing a crucial role in
the collection of real-time data. IoT is an application domain that integrates different technological and everyday objects [1].
These IoT sensors, often deployed in various regions across the United States, continuously generate data related to crucial
environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. They generate huge amounts of time series and
geospatial data. For example, in our project, we consider that for every minute, 20 sensors were distributed in distinct locations
within four different regions of the USA, providing a constant stream of weather data by giving its environmental parameters.
This information, critical for weather monitoring, climate research, and numerous other applications, must be efficiently stored
and analyzed. In many companies, sensor data is typically stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS),
like MySQL or Oracle, among others.MySQL is considered one of the better RDBMS solutions. [2] [3]. However, Relational
databases face significant challenges when dealing with large amounts of time-series data, which is a sequence of observations
or measurements collected over successive and equally spaced time intervals, and also spatial data, which Spatial data includes
geographic information like latitude and longitude coordinates for mapping and location-based analysis. Whereas time series
databases can efficiently handle this type of stream data [4]. The limitations of traditional databases are becoming more evident
as the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand. IoT includes all those smart devices connected to the internet, like weather
sensors. These devices keep sending data all the time, and relational databases struggle to keep up with this constant stream
of incoming data. Relational databases are built to handle structured data, where everything is stored in tables with rows and
columns. This structure is not very adaptable when dealing with the massive and constantly changing data generated by IoT
devices. Relational databases canâ€™t handle time-based indexing efficiently as they are not specifically meant to deal with this
type of data. This becomes a problem for organizations trying to keep up with the speed and volume of data pouring in. They
struggle to process it quickly and efficiently. Today, many companies prefer to migrate their data from relational databases
like MySQL to time-series databases like InfluxDB, while using PostGIS for spatial data. These specialized database systems
are designed to manage the unique characteristics of time series and spatial data, providing significant benefits over traditional
relational databases. InfluxDB [5] [6] is one of the best databases for handling time series data. It is best at efficiently handling
large volumes of data and idle sensor data, and it provides a flexible schema and optimized query capabilities that provide the
necessary infrastructure for real-time analysis. Spatial data includes data coordinates that represent physical data location [7].
When it comes to spatial data, PostGIS [8] [9] is one of the best databases for handling spatial data because it offers advanced
geospatial querying capabilities and its integration with PostgreSQL provides a robust platform for managing geographical
attributes and executing complex spatial queries. Also, PostGIS ensures the smooth handling of huge spatial data [10].
Data migration is the process of transferring data from one database management system to another [11]. This is a crucial
operation in this project. It enables a seamless transfer of data from MySQL to specialized databases like InfluxDB for time
series data and PostGIS [12] for spatial data. This transition is essential because it bridges the gap between the limitations
2
of traditional databases and the capabilities of these advanced solutions. A seamless data migration strategy preserves both
historical records and ongoing live data, integrating them into new databases without application downtime. This approach
ensures data quality, consistency, and continuous accessibility throughout the transition process. This project aims to migrate
weather sensor-generated time series and spatial data into influxDB and PostGIS databases, contributing to the field of data
migration and database management within the realm of computer science and addressing the rising demands of the IoT era.
As for the data migration process, we have created our schema in the MySQL database, which is a relational database that
contains both time series and spatial data of sensor data. We also designed the structure of buckets in InfluxDB and schema
in PostGIS in a way that they perform efficiently. Because the data model can significantly impact the database read and write
performance [13]. For the data in MySQL, we have generated a huge amount of data based on the three parameters (humidity,
temperature, and precipitation) and inserted this data into MySQL. In the migration process, we have used the InfluxDB API
to send the time series data to the InfluxDB and PostGIS client to send spatial data to the PostGIS, and in the migration
process, we have used multithreading for migration of both static and live data. Multithreading is a technique that allows us to
break down the data migration process into smaller tasks that can be done at the same time, similar to having multiple workers
collaborate on different parts of a job. This parallel processing significantly speeds up the migration, ensuring that both static
data move swiftly from MySQL and also live data to InfluxDB and PostGIS, improving the efficiency of the process.
For the migration process, We divided the entire migration process into 9 tasks, which will be outlined in the following
sections, and the outcomes of our project so far will be discussed in the Evaluation section
